    </div>

     <div id="tribute-info">Behind the dazzling lights, flamboyant outfits, and thunderous applause stood a deeply complex and private man. Born as Farrokh Bulsara, Freddie grew up between Zanzibar and India before moving to England in his teens. His Parsi heritage, boarding school upbringing, and experiences as an immigrant all shaped the man who would one day redefine rock stardom.

Freddie was known for his shyness offstage, a stark contrast to the powerful persona he projected in front of crowds. Friends described him as kind, witty, and deeply intelligent, with a love for art, fashion, and cats. Despite his fame, he valued privacy immensely and rarely spoke publicly about his personal life.

Yet, through his music and performances, he expressed layers of emotion and identity that connected with millions: confidence, vulnerability, defiance, and joy. He was unafraid to be boldly himself, breaking barriers in music, style, and gender expression during a time when conformity was expected.

Even in the face of his illness, Freddie chose to keep creating — recording some of his most powerful vocals during his final days. He lived and died on his own terms, leaving behind not just a musical legacy, but an example of how to live with fearless authenticity.
